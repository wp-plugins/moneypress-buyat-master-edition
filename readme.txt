This plugin allows you to display BuyAt listings on your web site by placing a simple shortcode in your page or post. Filter results by keyword, seller ID, or a combination of both. 

== Description ==

Our MoneyPress : BuyAt Edition plugin allows you to easily display products from BuyAt based on keywords you provide. It makes it simple to show product listings for anything relevant to your site. All product entries also come with images, current asking prices, and links to BuyAt to get further information about the product.

Sell any product on BuyAt and earn a commission with your BuyAt Partner ID or other approved affiliate program ID. If you are an approved BuyAt affiliate this plugin will help boost the income earning potential of your site in just a few easy steps.

After installing the plugin (see below for instructions) you can show products on any page on your site by using the ‘[ebay_show_items]’ shortcode.  For example, entering the shortcode

    [mp_buyat keywords="wordpress books"]

would populate your site with a listing of products matching those keywords.  You can put any keywords you like into the shortcode, to best suit your website.
